{"name":"fatsecret4j","tagline":"Java Client for using Fatsecret REST API","body":"## Welcome to JAVA Client for using Fatsecret REST API\r\nThis JAVA Client can help you to request data from Fatsceret REST API.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\nThere is no available JAVA library for using Fatsecret REST API when I searched on the Internet. This is my version of JAVA code which can help programmers to get the data from Fatsecret API for these methods foods.search, food.get, recipes.search, and recipe.get.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nInitialize an object of class 'FatSecretAPI' with your API Consumer Key and Shared Secret and call particular methods for getting the data.\r\n\r\n```java\r\nFatSecretAPI api = new FatSecretAPI(\"YOUR API CONSUMER KEY\", \"YOUR API SHARED SECRET\");\r\n//For getting food items\r\nJSONObject foods = api.getFoodItems(\"Burgers\");\r\n//For getting recipes\r\nJSONObject recipes = api.getRecipes(\"Burgers\");\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n@ranesr\r\n\r\n\r\n## Copyright and License\r\nCopyright (C) 2014 @ranesr\r\n\r\n[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Support or Contact\r\nIf you want to suggest anything, please contact me at [saurabhrrane@gmail.com](mailto:saurabhrrane@gmail.com).","google":"UA-43007500-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
